# Pokedex

To run the application you will need to have both the client and server running.

**To run the client:**
 
```
$ cd pokedex-client
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ Go to http://localhost:1234
```

**To run the server:**

```
$ cd graphql-pokemon-server
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ Go to http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

After running the backend, you can access https://localhost:4000/graphql in the browser, you'll be presented with a GraphQL Playground that allows you to run Queries and Mutations as well. So you are going to see the GraphQL Schema.
